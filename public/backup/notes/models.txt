Wrapup/conclusion

Call to action:



hyperthesis 1:
models are unhealthly thin: 

In women, being severely underweight can result in amenorrhea (absence of menstruation), infertility and possible complications during pregnancy. It can also cause anemia and hair loss. Being underweight is an established risk factor for osteoporosis, even for young people.

waist-to-stature ratio

Waist circumference divided by height   (both in cm)
underweight	...-0,40  - 40

up to 15
underweight	...-0,34

Ratio less than 35: Abnormally Slim to Underweight
Ratio 35 - 42: Extremely Slim
Ratio 42 to 46: Slender and Healthy
Ratio 46 to 49: Healthy, Normal Weight
Ratio 49 to 54: Overweight
Ratio 54 to 58: Seriously Overweight
Ratio over 58: Highly Obese

Scientist found that the height and waist ratio was a better predictor of high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes than body mass index. Doctors suggested tp use waist-to-height ratio as a screening tool.


Waist–hip ratio

BMI has traditionally been the chosen indicator by which to measure body size and
composition, and to diagnose underweight and overweight. However, alternative measures
that reflect abdominal adiposity, such as waist circumference, waist–hip ratio and waist–
height ratio, have been suggested as being superior to BMI in predicting CVD risk.

Twenty years ago, the average fashion model weighed 8 percent less than the average woman. Today, she weighs 23 percent less, it said. When asked for its source, the magazine cited the website of Rader Programs, which treats those with eating disorders.

we all should aim to keep  waist measurement less than half that of their height, found the scientists. That means a 6ft (72 inch) tall man should aim to keep his waist less than 36 inches, while a 5ft 4in (64 inch) woman should keep hers under 32 inches.
They have found that the easy-to-calculate ratio between the two is a better predictor of risk than the most widely measure of obesity, called body mass index (BMI).
The team, who analysed the health of some 300,000 people, found this ratio was a better predictor of high blood pressure, diabetes and cardiovascular events like heart attacks and strokes than body mass index.

She added that useful anthropometric measurements to determine fat distribution include: waist circumference or waist-hip ratio and body mass index (BMI) to determine the degree of obesity.
