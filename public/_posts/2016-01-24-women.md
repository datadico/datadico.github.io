A significant gender divide is still predominant in US movie scripts when looking at the age and word count of female and male roles. While, men seemed to have a longer career, female roles also lose out in contributing enough of their voice to the scripts compared to their dominant male counterparts.

In April, Polygraph published new data and an interactive data story on how female and male roles are distributed across the film landscape. The team scraped the data from movie scripts and merged them with actors and actresses appearances on the online movie database IMDb. In respect of this angle, looking at the development for instance in princess Disney movies, the time seems to run backwards. As discussed by Carmen Fought and Karen Eisenhauer, when the researchers counted male and female voices in Disney movies, Disney's princess revival films that launched in the nineties became more male dominated compared to their earlier editions. Even for Disney's Mulan, who's character represents a women, male voices were found to be dominant in the script.

# Makers, change your view!

How is the quality of a movie defined with an equal share of male and female voice appearances, you may ask? Well, you get movies like The Wizard of Oz and others, which have an equal distribution of male and female voices, and are awesome children movies. So why not! Would you want your kids to grow up in an equal society and learn values of equality, if there is no cost to the value of movies? Shouldn't movies follow the same rules of a modern society than anything else? Just like the saying goes "You Are What You Eat", it could well be true that we become what we watch. So could changing viewers visual input, also change the world of equality? Maybe! Every revolution takes time. But we don't know until moviemakers get started with it and feed us more equal content.
